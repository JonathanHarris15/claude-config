# .claude

My personal Claude Code configuration, synced across machines.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/` | Custom skills — a JIRA-native planning chain (`create-epic` → `grill-with-docs` → `to-prd` → `to-issues` → `implement`), plus `tdd`, `diagnose`, `prototype`, `research`, `triage`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `rebuild-mobile`. |
| `agents/` | Custom subagents. Markdown with frontmatter; the frontmatter sets the model, tools, and description. |
| `workflows/` | Multi-agent orchestration scripts. Plain JS that fans out subagents with real control flow — loops, pipelines, adversarial verification. |
| `commands/` | Custom slash commands. |
| `settings.json` | Global settings: effort level, theme, permission allowlist, hooks. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Instructions prepended to every session, in every project, on every machine. |

## The .gitignore is an allowlist, on purpose

It starts with `*` — ignore everything — and then explicitly un-ignores the
handful of paths above.

This is deliberate and worth preserving. Claude Code treats `~/.claude` as its
working directory: it stores your OAuth token in `.credentials.json`, full
session transcripts in `projects/` (~276MB, containing source from every project
you've touched), file snapshots in `file-history/`, and it adds new state
directories as it updates.

A denylist would silently start publishing each new state directory the day it
appears. An allowlist fails the other way: the worst case is that you forget to
sync something, not that you publish your credentials. **If you add new config,
add it to the allowlist explicitly. Don't flip the file to a denylist.**

Before your first push after any change to `.gitignore`:

```sh
git add -An --dry-run .        # exactly what would be tracked — read every line
git check-ignore -v .credentials.json history.jsonl projects/
```

Note that `~/.claude.json` — one level *up*, outside this repo — holds your user
ID, machine ID, prompt history, and MCP server configs (which often contain API
keys). It's out of scope here and should stay that way.

## Setting up a second machine

`git clone` won't work: Claude Code has already created `~/.claude` and put
things in it, and clone refuses a non-empty target. Attach the repo to the
existing directory instead.

```sh
cd ~/.claude

# Move aside anything the repo will bring, so checkout can't clobber local work.
mv settings.json settings.json.local 2>/dev/null
mv skills skills.local 2>/dev/null

git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
git fetch origin
git checkout -b main --track origin/main
```

Then diff the `.local` copies back in if they held anything you wanted, and
delete them. `settings.local.json` is machine-local by design — it stays
untracked, and each machine keeps its own.

## Keeping in sync

`git pull` in `~/.claude`. Claude Code reads these files on session start, so
restart any running session to pick up changes.
